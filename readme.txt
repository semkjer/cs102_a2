Hey Professor Turini,

This assignment performs all of the necessary operations with success. Each of the functions works with a properly formatted file, and exceptions are handled in most cases.
The program contains 11 distinct operations, including the escape sequence. My program is largely reworked from the prior assignment, as I had many errors with the exception handling
and the overall format of the assignment. In Assignment 1, I also failed to incorporate a win-loss record.

This project has some deviations, mainly the use of an orphan TennisMatchContainer. This helped to incorporate and handle entries prior to the player being inserted without throwing runtime errors, but unfortunately
there are still some flaws to my assignment. I used the ArrayList in my TennisMatchContainer instead of the LinkedList. The reason I did this is due to the fact I had prior experience working with ArrayList. In CS-101,
I had a couple of assignments in which we were required to use an ArrayList. In terms of functionality, I used an ArrayList since it increases the query speed of assignment.

Overall I think I did very well on the project, and I definitely learned a lot! Thank you for helping me debug some of my code regarding the file mechanics, as it helped to me to successfully export files.
